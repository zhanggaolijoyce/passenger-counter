I finish this simple project under Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/playlist/pY5b7sQ)

It can be used in counting. For a group, the number of counts is increased by 1 for each "Increment" button press. Then if you click the "save" button, the number of this group will be added to the sum, and the current counting number will return to 0, ready for counting the next group. And each time you click the "save" button, the sum will be shown after the previous ones, the format is like "4-8-17-".

I practiced html and javascript skills through this project. I learned how to show changeable texts on a specific location on a website and this is the first time I learned to interact with users through js.
